Welcome to my content aggregator project.
 This project contains different modules
 The first one is called extract, it extracts all the links from a news website
 The second one is called summarize and it creates a summary of an article by using its link
 the ones above use the newspaper3k module
 the last one is called sentiment_analysis and it gives the polarity and subjectivity of the news
 polarity quantifies whether a statement is positive or negative
 subjectivity refers to personal opinion, emotion or judgement
 the package used for the last one is called textblob
